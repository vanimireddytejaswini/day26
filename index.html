 <p>What is an email aggregator?
    In technology, the term aggregator refers to a tool that pulls information together in one place. It could be a daily digest that arrives in your email or a website that lists daily links.
    
    In the case of an email messaging platform, an aggregator brings your messages to one place, where you can easily sort through them and reply.
    
    Why use an email aggregator?
    Remembering to check multiple email accounts throughout the day, every day, can be challenging. You can easily forget to check one account and neglect an important client or delay the progress of a project.
    
    With an email aggregator, you no longer have to remember to manually log in and out of various accounts. You can pull everything together in one place. With the right tool, you can even combine multiple logins with the same email platform so that you’re checking everything at once.
    
    In addition to reducing the risk of errors, email aggregators can help you save time, boosting your productivity throughout the week. Many of these tools are free, so the only expense is the time it takes you to get things set up.
